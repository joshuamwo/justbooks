## Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

-   [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
-   [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)
-   [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or another database of your choice
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

    _(If you don't have Git, download the repository ZIP and extract it.)_

2.  **Backend Setup**

    ```bash
    composer install
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

    Update `.env` file with your database credentials:

    ```
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
    ```

    Run migrations:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the Application**

    Start the Laravel server:

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

    Start the Vue.js development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  **Access the Application**

    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to view the application.

        		Login with the following credentials:
        		- Email: admin@justbooks.com
        		- Password: Seol11@3

6.  **Try Out Features**

        		- Add some books to the library.
        		- Create a user account.
        		- Borrow a book using the user account.
        		- Approve the book loan from the admin dashboard.
        		- Test other features like returning a book, extending the loan...

### Additional Notes

-   Ensure you keep your database credentials secure.
-   Make sure ports `8000` (for Laravel) and `3000` (for Vue.js) are available.
-   For production, configure a proper web server like Apache or Nginx.
